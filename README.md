Project Overview
This project involves designing and building a comprehensive website for Botshabelo Babies and Preschool, a non-profit organisation in Kyalami, Midrand.

Primary goals: to increase sustainable funding and resource support while boosting community engagement.
Awareness: clearly articulate Botshabelo’s missions and impacts.

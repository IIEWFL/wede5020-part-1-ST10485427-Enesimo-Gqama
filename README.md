Project Overview

This project involves designing and building a comprehensive website for Botshabelo Babies and Preschool, a non-profit organisation in Kyalami, Midrand. The website acts as a digital platform for raising awareness, accepting donations, recruiting volunteers and providing information about organisations programs and impacts.

Website Goals and Objectives 

Primary goals: to increase sustainable funding and resource support while boosting community engagement.
Awareness: clearly articulate Botshabelo’s missions and impacts.
Recruit volunteers: creating different volunteer roles so everyone can apply. 
Donations: providing clear pathways for once-off donations and monthly donations. 

Key Features and Functionality

The website will have a fully responsive design that is geared for all devices making it accessible and to use on any mobile device. It will contain a secure donation processing system with several giving choices as well volunteer application forms to encourage community involvement. The program pages will feature the Babies Home and Preschool while other sections will discuss the organisation’s history, mission and vision.

CSS update: developed an external CSS stylesheet called styles.css and provided basic styling for colours, fonts and layouts. The website was made mobile responsive snd the navigation was optimised to perform seamlessly on both phones and tablets. There are changes on the buttons and forms, adding modest hover effects to enhance the overall user experience.
